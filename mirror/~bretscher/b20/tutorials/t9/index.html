  <li><h3>Asst 2 Part 2</h3>
  Today we're going to spend some time working with PHP, to give
  you ideas for how to approach part 2 of assignment 2.
  <p>
  The idea for part 2 is to generalize your solution for part 1,
  so that rather than just displaying a nice Web page for one
  particular movie, you allow the user to choose from among a
  (predefined) set of movies, and using PHP, you'll show the user
  a nice Web page for their chosen movie.
  <p>
  The raw material from which your PHP script will operate is
  comprised of a set of files, stored in a directory whose name
  is derived from a movie title; for example, the <code>vampire</code>
  directory contains these files:
<pre>
info.txt      overview.txt  review2.txt  review4.txt  review6.txt  review8.txt
overview.png  review1.txt   review3.txt  review5.txt  review7.txt
</pre>
  <p>
  Let's consider each of these files based on their content, as detailed
  in the assignment handout, and see how they are related to the rendered
  Web page.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/cscb20w17/bretsche/assignments/a2/a2.html#info">info.txt</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/cscb20w17/bretsche/assignments/a2/a2.html#overview">overview.txt</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/cscb20w17/bretsche/assignments/a2/vampire/overview.png">overview.png</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca/courses/cscb20w17/bretsche/assignments/a2/a2.html#review">review1.txt, ... reviewN.txt</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  OK, now how are you supposed to obtain a copy of these files?
  Linked to the handout is a reference to a
  <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/b20/tutorials/t9/www.utsc.utoronto.ca/bretscher/b20/assignments/a2/a2.zip"><code>a2.zip</code></a> file;
  this is a compressed archive containing all the movie description
  files for part 2.  Clicking on the link will download the files
  to your local machine.
<!--  Alternatively, you can copy the archive on mathlab using:
<pre>
cp /courses/webspace/cscb20w17/bretsche/assignment/a2/a2.zip .
</pre>-->

  To extract the contents of the archive use the unzip command;
  on mathlab/cmslab (note this will extract into the directory where you
  run the command):
<pre>
unzip a2.zip
</pre>

  <h4>Part 2 Structural Outline</h4>
  <p>
  Your solution to Part 2 will be organized as a set of PHP definitions
  followed by HTML code.  This HTML is carried over from Part 1,
  but with injections of PHP code to supply values relevant to
  the user-selected movie replacing fixed references to the vampire
  movie used in Part 1.
  <h5>PHP tasks:</h5>
  <ul>
	<li>read the "film" parameter
	<li>read the relevant film's <code>info.txt</code> file to 
	obtain the film's" name, year, score.
	<li>set a variable to refer to the rating-image src (URL)
	(rottenbig.png or freshbig.png) based on the score value
	<li>set a variable to refer to the overview.png image src (URL)
	<li>read the overview.txt file and convert it's contents into
	an array of HTML &lt;dd> elements (&lt;dt> and &lt;dd>).
	<li>read the review.txt files into an array.
  </ul>
  <h5>In your HTML code:</h5>
  <ul>
	<li>refer to PHP variables set above, e.g.
<pre>
&lt;title>&lt;?= $name ?> - Rancid Tomatoes&lt;/title>
</pre>
  </ul>

  <li><h3>PHP Coding Tips</h3>
  <p>First, a word of general advice:  develop your PHP code in small,
	incremental steps.  PHP is relatively easy to learn and write,
	but when you combine PHP with a browser, it can be difficult
	to debug errors, since the browser shows only the HTML rendered
	by your PHP. 
  <p>Work on one feature at a time, and get that
	part working before moving on to the next.  When you change your
	code, do so in small steps, testing after each change that you
	have not broken your code.
  <p>Common errors when writing PHP code include forgetting to close
	a PHP code block with "?>"
	(you'll see an error about "unexpected $end"), 
	and forgetting to use an "=" when you want to output a PHP
	expression value (the value won't appear in your output) or forgetting the ";".

  <p>Let's recall some PHP constructs from class that you may find useful for Asst 2.
  <dd>
    <dt><code>$my_var; $my_primes=array(2,3,5,7,11);</code></dt>
    <dd>Declares variable $my_var.  Declares and initializes array
 	variable $my_primes.  PHP variables always begin with the character "$".
	Like Python, PHP variables can have different types at different
	points in execution; arrays can have a mix of content types.</dd>

<br/>
 
    <dt><code>“str” . $var . “str”  // str catenation</code></dt>
    <dd>
	String catenation is denoted by a period (".") in PHP (not "+").
    </dd>

<br/>

    <dt><code>$_REQUEST[“name”];</code></dt>
    <dd>The user will invoke your PHP script with a URL parameter,
	denoted by a string like <code>?film=vampire</code>, as in this URL:
<pre>
https://mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca/cscb20w16/bretsche/a2/fresh.php?film=vampire
</pre>
	Your PHP code will use <code>$_REQUEST</code> to read the film
	parameter, and could assign it to a variable as in:
<pre>$film = $_REQUEST["film"];</pre>

    <dt><code>$array = file(string);</code></dt>
    <dd>
You need to be able to read the content of the various film-information
files described above.  <code>file(string)</code> returns the content
of the string-named file as an array of lines.  For example, to read
the text of <code>overview.txt</code> into array $synopsis:
<pre>
$synopsis = file("overview.txt");
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>$array = glob(string)</code></dt>
    <dd>
<code>glob(string)</code> lets you pattern-match on filenames.
PHP provides several different pattern-defining strings,
including "*" which matches 0 or more characters,
"?" which matches any single character, [abcd] which
matches any single character listed between the brackets.
For example, to get an array of the filenames review1.txt, review2.txt, ...
in a directory, you could write:
<pre>
$reviews = glob("review*.txt");
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>for (init; end; delta) { };</code></dt>
    <dd>
A <code>for</code> loop initializes a control variable, 
gives a final value for the control to exit the loop,
and indicates how the control changes on each iteration.  For example:
<pre>
for ($i=0; $i&lt;10; $i++) { statements which may reference $i }
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>foreach ($array as $item) { };</code></dt>
    <dd>
<code>foreach</code> is a simplified form of <code>for</code> loop
that works on the elements of an array.  Like the Python
<code>for element in list:</code> structure, during the i'th
iteration of the loop, the value of <code>$item</code> will
be the element of the list indexed by i-1; for example, on the
2nd iteration, <code>$item</code> will be the $array entry at index 1.
<p>
Consider the problem of reading multiple review files for Asst 2.
To do that, glob() to get an array of filenames,
foreach() to iterate through the glob() results,
and file() to read the review file contents into the 
an array variable.
</dd>

    <dt><code>list($a,$b,$c) = array</code></dt>
    <dd>
Creates named variables to refer to the elements of an array.  E.g.
<pre>
$info = array('coffee', 'brown', 'caffeine');

// define individual variables to refer to the elements of array $info
list($drink, $color, $power) = $info;
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>if (cond) { statements };</code></dt>
    <dd>
	If the <code>cond</code> expression
	evaluates to true then perform the statements.
    </dd>

<br/>

    <dt><code>function my_func(parameters) { statements }</code></dt>
    <dd>
	define a function, that would be called by it's name.
    </dd>
</li><li><h3>Sample PHP Code</h3>
  <a href="overview.txt">overview.php</a> provides a snippet of PHP code
  that follows the general pattern you'll use for your fresh.php in Part 2.
  The code is not complete, but the omitted parts (marked by "...") should
  be fairly straightforward to complete.
