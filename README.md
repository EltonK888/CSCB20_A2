# cscb20 A2 - redesign course website

## directory structure

- `Assignment2`: files to hand in

- `mirror`: mirror of https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/b20/

## task
- mockups

  - to show how the user will interact with your website
  
  - at least 10 user stories

  - examples
    1. "As a student user, the student must be able to see all the lecture slides when clicking on the 'lectures' button/link."
    2. "As a student user, the student must be able to see all the Office Hours for this week on Google Calendar or Google Maps (maybe you want to show where these office hours are happening?), when clicking on the `Office Hours' button/link."
    3. "As a student user, when I click on the lab's page on the CSCB20 website, a grid layout of all the labs must be shown with information of all the TA."
